中间穿插着两人各自的一些成长经历, 失去亲人, 与父母的关系, 父母对个人的影响等.

几个概念:

- Life Force
- Part X
- String of Pearls
- the shadow 

- the snapshot
- the maze

整个过程, 非常安静听两个好友的闲聊, 然后你能感觉到他们在这种聊天中, 关系在递进.

标题如, 丧人必看, 呃, 其实并不是给丧人看的.

#### LIfe Force

life force: (wiki) the vital principle or animating force within all living things(生命力?)

想要知道自己该做些什么, 第一步先激活你的生命力.

To find out what you should be doing, like, who you are. is to activate your life force.

three levels of the life force, think of it as a pyramid, 

- highest tier: your relationship with yourself

  > get yourself in a relationship with your unconscious.
  >
  > 与自己的潜意识建立关系.
  >
  > one trick about this is writing.

- your relationship with other people

  > take the initiative(采取主动)
  >
  > e.g. you could invite somebody out to lunch that you don't find interesting.

- bottom level: your relationship with your physical body

  > exercising (缺乏运动)
  >
  > Diet
  >
  > Sleeping

针对尚未做到这些的人.

热衷于和自己的生命力建立联系. 

to be passionate about connecting to your life force



Stutz的童年: 5岁前在Bronx 长大 , 后搬到曼哈顿, 爸爸热爱社交, 妈妈不喜社交, 弟弟 Eddie,  3岁时, 患病过世.

弟弟的过世对童年时代的 Stutz 造成了隐性压力, 父母唯一的儿子,无信仰父母, 父亲要求他一定要成为一名医生.

everybody was avidly to accepting what was going on. that was part X



#### Part X

X: the impossible

Part X is the judgemental part of you, the antisocial part of you. a invisible force that wants to keep you from changing or growing, block your evolution

**how to get ride of Part X?**

you can't . you can defeat him temporarily, but he's always gonna keep coming back.

there are 3 aspects of reality that nobody gets to void.

- Pain
- Uncertainty
- constant work

learn how to love the process of dealing with those three things.(学着去爱上应对这三个部分的过程.)

人类最高的创造性表达, 是在逆境中创造新事物

the highest creative expression for a human being is to be able to create something new right in the face of adversity.

对于这部电影的讨论, 电影拍摄了两年多, 两人穿着同样的衣服, 假装这是一个session,  Jonah 的一些困惑, 改变. 

Stutz: you can't move forward without being vulnerable.

用珍珠的例子来引导后面的拍摄.

#### String of Pearls

我是把下一颗珍珠串在绳子上的人

"I am the one who puts the next pearl on the string."



我只从我采取行动的习惯的角度, 看待自己.

I look at myself just in terms of the habits with which I take action

每颗珍珠都有着相同的价值.

(托斯卡尼尼: 我现在正在做的事, 就是我一生中最重要的事, 不管是指挥一个交响乐团, 或是在剥一个橙子.)

真正的自信, 在于生活在不确定性中

true confidence is living in the uncertainty and moving forward.

每颗珍珠里面有一个黑点, 有💩️

there's gonna be a turd in it.

Jonah:

**instead of a turd inside of a pearl. there is always a pearl around every turd.**



#### The Shadow

everyone has a shadow 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lupeipei/blogImages/master/imagesshadow.png)

it's the part of themselves they're ashamed of.

**Tool time:**

想象一下你生命中的某个时刻, 当你感到自卑, 难堪, 遭受拒绝, 沮丧,  并且为此感到羞耻, 你希望自己没有这样的一面. 但你有, 不仅如此, 你还无法摆脱它.

与你的阴影对话, 问他/她 对你有何感觉.

阴影需要关注, 但是它需要的不是世界的关注, 而是你的关注.

你能做什么来弥补, 你这么长时间没有关注它的事实?

tool: visualize a time in your life, when you felt inferior, embarrassed, rejected, despondent that you are shamed of it. It's a part of you that you wish you were not. but you are, and not only that, you can't get rid of it. 

Talk to your shadow and ask him how does he feel about you, how you have dealt with him, how you've treated him.

The Shadow needs attention, but he needs the attention not from the world, but you

I want you to ask your shadow, what can you do make up for the fact that you didn't pay attention to him for such a long time?

满足真实的自我.

content with my true self.

与阴影面同步, 是一种完整性.完整性意味着 "我不需要其他任何东西, 我是完整的"

the idea of being in sync with the Shadow, It's a sense of wholeness. wholeness means I don't need anything else. I am whole the way I am.

#### The Snapshot

亦称为: 幻觉之域

the Realm of illusion.

快照的本质:

静止, 没有深度, 达到了某种完美状态

电影中, Jonah 妈妈加入对话,  Jonah 与母亲的沟通,  延伸到 Stutz 与母亲的关系.

Stutz: She had this thing with men, for obvious reasons. She's stuck in the Maze for 40 years, 50 years.

#### the Maze

迷宫总是涉及其他人,  是Part X 的产物.  因为 Part X 想要公平.

The Maze always involves other people. It's the product of Part X, becuase Part X wants fairness.

典型的一个例子是, 一个人只愿意去谈论另一个人, "一旦对方补偿我, 我就放下这件事", 可能他们对你发火, 或者做了伤害你的事, 你觉得他们亏待了你, 而你对公平的追求, 让你的人生搁浅. 你选择困在迷宫, 而不是选择向前看.



想要觉得自己得到了回报, 想要觉得事情重新获得了平衡, 只能从行为本身去获得满足感. 这个也称做 主动联接的爱.

the way you feel you're getting paid, the way you feel things are being rebalanced.

is to get your satisfaction from the exercise itself. that's called active love.

**Tool time:**

想象自己被一个 完全由爱组成的宇宙包围着, 这是个几乎充满爱的能量的世界,  感觉你自己吸收了宇宙所有的爱,  然后温柔而有力地, 把它全部放在你的心里, 就在那一刻, 你是整个宇宙的爱的主要领导人.

而你要做的是, 你要看着你生气的人, 你讨厌的人, 你鄙视的人, 然后把你集中的所有的爱, 传送到对方身上. 

你毫无保留, 你给予一切

你感觉到你的爱, 进入了对方的身体

有那么一瞬间, 你俩合而为一.

在那一刻, 你觉得" 要是我能与这个混蛋合而为一", 我就能和任何人合而为一.

那是一种能力感, 几乎是一种掌控感.

这并不是为了让你去爱你讨厌的人, 这是为了让你感到完整, 然后把你从迷宫中解放出来.

image you're surrounded by a universe completely made out of love,  It's a world that's almost dense with loving energy, feel yourself taking in all the love in the universe. and gently, but firmly, place all of it in your heart, right at that moment, you're the principal leader of love in the whole universe. 

what you do is you want to see the person you're angry at, that you hate, that you despise, and you send all this love you've concentrated, towards the other person.

You hold nothing back, you give everything.

You feel your love enter the other person's body

for a minute, you become one.

At that point, you feel like, "if I can become one with this bastard, I can become one with anybody"

And that's the sense of prowess, almost of mastery

It's to make you feel whole and then free you from the Maze.



Stutz romantic relationship: 一段断断续续 40 年的关系, 她有一些家事, 我有帕金森, 帕金森成了可以逃避 做情感上会让他恐惧的决定的一个借口.

#### Radical Acceptance

全然接纳

当事情出错时, 你必须建立一种挤出汁液的条件反射, 挤出汁液意味着找出有意义的东西. 找出一些积极的东西,

when something goes wrong, you have to create a reflex to squeeze the juice out. Squeezing the juice means finding something meaningful. to find something that's positive.

带你走向意义的世界的, 不是伟大的事物,  而是那些微小的事物.

You don't get to the world of meaning through big things, you get it through small things.

#### The Grateful Flow

感恩之流不是指你感恩的东西, 感恩之流是创造这些东西的过程.

The Grateful flow is not the things you're grateful for, The Grateful flow is the process of creating these things.

**Tool time:**

闭上眼睛, 说出两个或者三个, 最多四个, 

越小越好, 因为它迫使你集中感恩之情, 

慢慢来, 好好去感受那股感恩之情.

接下来, 你要感觉自己, 即将产生另一个感恩的念头, 但你把这个念头打住, 所以你感受到的, 只是这股产生感恩念头的力量.

随着它变得越来越强大, 你感觉自己被它征服. 

这就是感恩之流.

关键是不要重复说同样的东西, 它必须是一个具有创造性的行为.

当你不得不去挖掘和努力寻找这些东西时, 那个过程本身就会改变你的心情.

you say two or three, at most, four things you're grateful for.

the smaller the thing, the better, because it forces you to concentrate gratefulness

you wanna do it nice and slow,  you want to feel the gratefulness

the next thing you do is you feel that you're going to create another grateful thought, but you don't.

you block it, So all you feel is the force that would crate a grateful thought.

and as it gets stronger and stronger, you feel taken over by it.

That's the Grateful flow.

The key is not saying the same thing over and over that you're grateful for.

You wanna make it a creative act.

when you have to dig and work on it to find these things.

That process itself will change your mood.

#### Loss Process

Loss Processing is a tool that allows you to process loss

人们往往在丧失未发生前, 就一直担心它会发生

before there's a loss, they're just worrying about a loss.

获得所谓的不执着的效力. 意味着, 我可以去追求一样东西, 但是我可以接受不拥有它.

The goal of this is to get what's called the potency of nonattachment.

That means I can purchase something, but I'm willing not to have it. I am willing to lose.

**Tool time:**

首先挑出一件, 你觉得自己过于依恋的东西

现在想象你在抓住这个东西,  如果它不是物质的东西, 也无所谓, 想象你抓住它, 就像抓住树上的树枝一样,  你害怕放手, 但是你还是放手了. 当你放手时, 你开始往下掉.

但那并不是一种不好的感觉, 反而是出乎意料地缓慢而温柔, 你在往下掉, 你说, "我愿意失去一切"

你必须默默地说. 你要真正感受到其背后的意图. 在你说这句话的那一刻, 你落在了位于下方的太阳表面上, 整个身体燃烧了起来, 此刻, 你已经失去了一切. 因为肉体是拥有事物的前提. 如今你的肉体燃烧殆尽, 你就变成了其中的一缕阳光. 你在向四面八方放射着光芒. 你放射的是一种非常有爱的, 给予的, 流动的感觉, 你环视四周, 看到你周围有无限多的其他太阳, 它们都在向外放射着光芒, 就像你掉进的那颗太阳一样, 然后你听到所有的太阳齐声说: 我们无处不在.

这个世界被称为太阳世界.

The first thing I want you to do is pick out something that you feel you've become too attached to. Sth where you're loath to let go of it.

Now, imagine you're  grasping this thing, and if it's not a material thing, it doesn't matter.

Just imagine you're  grasping it. like you're grasping onto a branch on a tree.

you are afraid to let go, but you let go anyway.

and when you let go, you start to fall.

It's not a bad sensation though, the falling is actually kind of slow and gentle, to your surprise, but you're dropping down, and you say, "I am willing to lose everything"

And you have to say it silently but you want to really feel the, intent behind that.

And the moment you say that, you hit the surface of a sun that was down there below you, and your body burns up.

Now, at that point ,you have lost everything. because the instrument of possession is your physical body.

So, if your physical body's burnt up, you're just one sunbeam amongst all these other sunbeams. you're radiating outward in all directions. and what you're radiating is a very loving, giving, outflowing sensation.

then you look around, and you see, all around you , an infinite number of other suns. just like the one you're inside of, all of which are radiating outwards. and then you hear the suns, all of them, saying in unison: "we are everywhere"

This world is called a sun world.

如果面对亲密关系中伴侣, 家人, 朋友的离开?

> 不是让自己变得完全无牵挂, 而是努力不让任何人, 地方或者事物的离开彻底夺走你自己的整个存在以及自我的完整感.



#### 尾声

上次Stutz提到那段持续了40年的关系, 在那次谈话后, Stutz 去主动联系了她

一次对 Stutz 本人改变很大的谈话. 放下心防, 抛开恐惧, 去尝试.
